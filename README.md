<p>Equifox is a FLL team. They needed a way to present themselves at the annual competition without having to carry around lots of posters. They asked me to make them a website so that they can show who they are and how their robot is comming along. As a result they are now able to show their work. For this I used a Bootstrap navbar.</p>
